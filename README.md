## What is it?
A simple application using a express.js server to keep your notes organized!

## Why did I make this?
I wanted a simple application that would be able to keep consistent notes for taks and chores i need to keep on top of. I was tired of pulling out an index card, finding a pencil or pen, and quickly atempting to chicken-scratch some notes about whatever subject i was concerned with, now i can just open up the webpage and write down my thoughts! ( i type much faster than handwriting so this seemed like a win-win for me)

## How did I go about building this?
This application was built with express.js. Javascript and some html. The application will also be deployed on Heroku!
